health issue and are less willing to ask for help.

regulation strategies and have emotion
dysregulation problems are more affected

0:00:35.480,0:00:36.960
by high pressure.

0:00:37.740,0:00:41.940
Besides, emotion regulation as a potentially unifying function

0:00:41.940,0:00:47.200
of diverse symptom presentations and maladaptive behaviors.

0:00:52.640,0:00:56.220
Sometimes I am overly
emotional and unable to think rationally

0:00:56.240,0:00:59.980
so I feel that I need emotional
management.

0:01:04.920,0:01:09.940
I often feel depressed because of my boss's blame,
and sometimes even hurt myself.

0:01:14.360,0:01:18.860
Sometimes I even get angry because of small things that others don't care about.

0:01:19.520,0:01:22.760
People around me said that my mood is very ups and downs,

0:01:23.120,0:01:26.280
so they donâ€™t dare to persuade me when I am emotional.

0:01:27.600,0:01:31.900
When I go to complain to my friends, they often don't understand my feelings.

0:01:32.180,0:01:35.440
They think that I am often too emotional about small things.

0:01:42.380,0:01:46.780
If I am in a bad mood, I will relieve myself by writing a diary.

0:01:47.500,0:01:50.980
I would like to find someone to talk
about things that make me depressed

0:01:50.980,0:01:55.260
however I usually can't find someone
willing to listen.

0:02:03.380,0:02:08.960
After interviewed some of our target users and a counseling psychologist who

0:02:08.970,0:02:14.040
who works at the Center of Counseling in National Chiao Tung University. We found

0:02:14.040,0:02:18.180
that they transfer their attention from things bothering them when bad mood

0:02:18.180,0:02:23.220
affect their daily life. They met barriers while contacting other people

0:02:23.220,0:02:27.780
when they want to have a conversation
with other people. Some people try to

0:02:27.780,0:02:33.980
suppress their feeling without aware of it
 may cause emotional breakdowns.

0:02:33.980,0:02:39.720

chatting, self-recording and emotion reminding.

When some people was in a bad mood, they couldn't find
 a friend to talk with.

0:02:52.890,0:02:59.040
Since they might be busy doing something else or
 didn't pick up their phone.

0:02:59.040,0:03:04.800

0:03:04.800,0:03:07.240
